# Destroy_ALL (formerly Anti-Anti-Hate)
Status: Alpha (un-tested)

## Description
Protection of freedom of, ideas, thoughts, alternatives to the ONE WAY of the `History/Culture/Event Controllers`. A multi-threaded, batch and powershell, script, that will in this order...
1. Check locations of Safe Folders, if any not found, then ask, Continue/Exit. (This important factor in the update, as it may pause, reason to ensure folders are correct, also risk of activating script in maintenance).
2. Erase all data on non-C drives.
3. Shedule secure erase of C, then Force-close all non-essential processes, Force Restart, and then secure erase C.
4. It would presumably Crash during/after erasing C, hopefully your files will be there.

### Instruction
1. Extract the files directly in "C:\", so you remember, its there (no brainer location) and wont accidentally click it. Then just leave them there.
2. Do not run it, its going to mess your computer up, so be careful, but, you could possibly edit the line  `$SafeFolder = "C:\Users"` to select  "Folder (and subfolders) to exclude from deletion", to point to your actual folder with your logins/identity etc, stuff you cant re-download.
3. Unless there are a bunch of paid thugs at the door going on about, "2000 years of persecution aint enough" and "I'm just following orders", and possibly even "I'm definately going to heaven now", in which case you should take precautions, run to the computer, and then, so long as you are sure you want to do it, because normally there are NO CIRCUMSTANCES people would normally want to do this, that is deleting ALL your files, as you may need them, but if your sure you dont right click "Run as Administrator", and watch the fireworks. 
4. Possibly ensuring that things such as media editing packages with unsaved files are all closed would be good to ensure restart occurs. 
5. There is no 5 unless you messed up with 3. But no guarantees, I will not be testing this software any time soon, but will get it checked over several times.

### Development
- No plans. Possibly check over with good ai, better than deepseek.

# Notes
- Remember There is no Guarantee that the actual full set of processes programmed here in this program will actually work, I totally expect unintended results as the program is "Un-Tested", and should be tested first on a freshly setup test computer, the likes of which I have not got round to setting up...yet, but I may do so later when completing this program becomes a priority.
- This program was created after a 18 year old was arrested for modern verison of the "Jolly Roger Cookbook", and I believe it is injust due to being a part of "UK Culture". UK people do not always have the right to act, but do have the right to, intellectual curiosity, personal research, and free speech, that includes sharing of any given information, so long as there is no, ACTUAL and REAL, relating crime, Required at the time by the creators and/or Later on enacted by the end user.
