# Destroy_ALL (formerly Anti-Anti-Hate)
Status: Alpha (un-tested)

## Description
Protection of freedom of, ideas, thoughts, alternatives to the ONE WAY of the `History/Culture/Event Controllers`. A multi-threaded, batch and powershell, script, that will in this order...
1. Check locations of Safe Folders, if any not found, then ask Continue/Exit, otherwise continue. (This important as it may pause).
2. Delete all files/folders in all drives in multi-thread, excluding `C:` drive.
3. Shedule secure erase of C, then Force-close all non-essential processes, Force Restart, and then secure erase C. It would presumably Crash during/after erasing C. 
4. Hopefully Safe Folders will be there, so no historical/cultural documentations there.

### Instruction
1. Extract the files directly in "C:\", so you remember, its there (no brainer location) and wont accidentally click it. Then just leave them there. Its, kindof obvious and relevantly named, "Destroy_ALL".
2. Do not run it, its going to mess your computer up, so be careful, but, you should edit the lines of the `$SafeFolder = "C:\Users"` to select  "Folder (and subfolders) to exclude from deletion", to point to your actual folder with your logins/identity etc, stuff you cant re-download.
3. As and when, hench-men arrive at the door going on about, "2000 years of persecution isnt enough" and/or "I'm just following orders sir" and/or "I'm definately going to heaven for this", while showing "ID" when asked but then attempting to force entry, in which case you should take precautions, but otherwise try to remember normally there are NO CIRCUMSTANCES people would normally want to "Destroy", their or anything near their, computer. Running the program involves `Right Click` then "Run as Administrator". It will pause with a prompt if there are issues with the "Safe Locations". 
4. While waiting, quickly ensuring that open programs are closed promptly would be good to ensure restart occurs normally. 
5. There is no intended 5 unless you messed up with 3.

### Development
- No plans. Possibly check over with good ai, better than deepseek.

# Notes
- Remember There is no Guarantee that the actual full set of processes programmed here in this program will actually work, I totally expect unintended results as the program is "Un-Tested", and should be tested first on a freshly setup test computer, the likes of which I have not got round to setting up...yet, but I may do so later when completing this program becomes a priority.
- This program was created after a 18 year old was arrested for modern verison of the "Jolly Roger Cookbook", and I believe it is injust due to being a part of "UK Culture". UK people do not always have the right to act, but do have the right to, intellectual curiosity, personal research, and free speech, that includes sharing of any given information, so long as there is no, ACTUAL and REAL, relating crime, Required at the time by the creators and/or Later on enacted by the end user.
